                                advancement of local shoe brands in Indonesia. Many users still struggle to discover and
                                explore quality local shoe brands such as Aerostreet, Compass, Johnson, Athletika, and
                                many others. Unfortunately, many people tend to prefer international brands like Adidas
                                and others over local products. Therefore, we created this website to help enhance the
                                visibility and popularity of local shoe brands in Indonesia, as well as to encourage
                                people to better understand and appreciate domestic products.</p>

                                information about various Pokémon, including their names, types, and abilities. <br><br>

                                of each Pokémon and provide easy access to data provided by the Pokémon API. I believe
                                that by utilizing modern technology like React.js, the user experience in interacting
                                with Pokémon data will become more engaging and informative. With a clean and intuitive
